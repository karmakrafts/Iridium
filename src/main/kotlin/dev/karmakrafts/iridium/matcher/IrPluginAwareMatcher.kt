 * Base interface for matchers that need access to the Kotlin IR plugin context.

 * which are essential for working with Kotlin's IR (Intermediate Representation)
 * in compiler plugins and tests. It serves as a foundation for more specialized
 * matchers like [IrTypeAwareMatcher] and [IrElementMatcher].
 *
 * Implementations of this interface can use the plugin context to access compiler
 * services and the IR built-ins to work with Kotlin's type system in the IR phase.
