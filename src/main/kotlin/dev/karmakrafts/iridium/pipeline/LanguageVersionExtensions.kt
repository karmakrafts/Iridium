 * Creates a [LanguageVersionSettingsImpl] with the given language version and API version.

 * This extension function provides a convenient way to create language version settings
 * by combining a language version with an API version using an infix notation.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * val settings = LanguageVersion.KOTLIN_1_9 withApi ApiVersion.KOTLIN_1_9
 * ```
 *
 * @param version The API version to use
 * @return A new [LanguageVersionSettingsImpl] with the specified language and API versions
